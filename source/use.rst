How to use resources
**********************************
Computing@Unipi.it is moving towar a **"bring your own software stack"** philosofy, as users are encouraged to define their software stacks, bringing them in the form of containers.

We think this approach to foster reproducibility and portability, partially freeing the system administrators from responsibilities due to the existence and coexistence of different software and l;ibreries.

Currently we offer `SLURM <https://slurm.schedmd.com/>`_ scheduler.
