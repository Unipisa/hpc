Current State and Future Development
----------------------------------------
.. TODO: LINKARE

As the Unipi Data center is an evolving project, all the technical documentation is structured by "states" :
.. where **Current state** describe the current solutions, and **next steps** describe what is the project for the future.

* **Current state** describe the current solutions; 
* **Next step** describe what is the project for the future.

Indeed, because the Data center is an evolving object, also the adopted technical solutions are evolving.
The experience obtained analizyng the *current state* usage pattern makes emerge some critical points that we plan to tackle by the *next step*.   

Currently we are considering the following *next steps* :

- LDAP user management -> `COmanage <https://spaces.at.internet2.edu/display/COmanage/Home>`_ ( `here an example <https://wiki.geant.org/display/AARC/COmanage+SSH+pilot>`_)
- Containers -> `SPACK <https://spack.readthedocs.io/>`_ ( `here an introduction <https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/sc19/_downloads/b1ba74e2cc65aa5fb22428bd0e71d19a/Spack-SC19-Tutorial.pdf>`_ )
