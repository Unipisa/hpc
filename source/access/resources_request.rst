Account liability
*********************************

.. warning::

   It is very important to protect your account. Therefore:
   
   - You should choose a strong passphrase to protect your account.
   - You should not share your account with other users.
   - For added security, you may also consider to use public/private key pair.
     The procedure is explained on ":ref:`create key pair`".


.. _create key pair:

Create a public/private key pair
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A key pair consists of a private and a public key.

#. The private key is stored on the computer(s) you use to access the VSC
   infrastructure and always stays there.
#. The public key is stored on the  VSC systems you want to access, allowing
   to prove your identity through the corresponding private key.
  
How to generate such a key pair depends on your operating system. We
describe the generation of key pairs in the client sections for

- :ref:`Linux<generating keys linux>`,
- :ref:`Windows <generating keys windows>` and
- :ref:`macOS<generating keys macos>` (formerly OS X).
