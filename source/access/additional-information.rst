Additional information
----------------------

Before you apply for Unipi HPC account, it is useful to first check whether
the infrastructure is suitable for your application. Windows or macOS
programs for instance cannot run on our infrastructure as we use the
Linux operating system on the clusters. The infrastructure also should
not be used to run applications for which the compute power of a good
laptop is sufficient. 

The pages on the 
.. :ref:`tier1 hardware` and :ref:`tier2 hardware`

in this part of the website give a high-level description of our
infrastructure. You can find more detailed information in the user
documentation on the user portal. When in doubt, you can also contact
your `local support team <get in touch_>`_. This does not require a Unipi HPC account but only a Unipi account.

Your account also includes two blocks of disk space: your home
directory and data directory. Both are accessible from all Unipi HPC clusters.
When you log in to a particular cluster, you will also be assigned one
or more blocks of temporary disk space, called scratch directories.
Which directory should be used for which type of data, is explained in
the page 
.. ":ref:`data location`".

Your Unipi HPC account does not give you access to all available software. You
can use all free software and a number of compilers and other
development tools. For most commercial software, you must first prove
that you have a valid license or the person who has paid the license on
the cluster must allow you to use the license. For this you can contact
your local support team.
